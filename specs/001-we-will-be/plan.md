# Implementation Plan: My Closet Virtual Try-On

**Branch**: `001-we-will-be` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-we-will-be/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

A web application that allows users to upload clothing photos to build a virtual closet, then use AI-powered virtual try-on to see how they would look wearing selected items. The system uses Gemini AI for image generation, Supabase for storage, and a Next.js frontend with Python backend for image processing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (backend), Node.js 18+ (frontend), TypeScript 5.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, FastAPI, Supabase, Google Gemini AI, Pillow (PIL)
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL (metadata) + Supabase Storage (images)
**Testing**: Jest (frontend), pytest (backend), Playwright (E2E)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: 2s page load, 500ms API responses, 30s AI processing
**Constraints**: <50MB image uploads, 100 concurrent users, mobile-responsive
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ users, 10k+ clothing items, 100+ daily virtual try-ons
**Tier Limits**: Free (100 items, 100 try-ons/month), Premium (1000 items, 1000 try-ons/month)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity First**: ✅ Architecture uses minimal necessary components - Next.js frontend, Python API, Supabase storage. No complex microservices or unnecessary abstractions.

**Minimal File Structure**: ✅ Single Next.js app with API routes, Python service for AI processing, straightforward folder structure.

**Clean Code Standards**: ✅ All components will be immediately understandable with clear naming, comprehensive comments, and simple patterns.

**Up-to-Date Dependencies**: ✅ All dependencies are latest stable versions - Next.js 14, Python 3.11+, latest Supabase and Gemini SDKs.

**User-Friendly Design**: ✅ Intuitive user flows with clear navigation, drag-and-drop uploads, visual feedback, and guided virtual try-on process.

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js application with API routes for backend functionality, Python service for AI processing, and Supabase for data storage. This minimizes complexity while providing all required functionality.

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitution violations - architecture follows simplicity principles*

## Implementation Status

### Phase 0: Research ✅ COMPLETED
- **research.md**: Technical decisions documented
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with email/social login
- Storage: Supabase Storage with optimized bucket structure  
- AI Integration: Python service with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
- Image Processing: Pillow for compression and optimization
- Database: PostgreSQL with RLS and performance indexes
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript

### Phase 1: Design ✅ COMPLETED
- **data-model.md**: Complete database schema with entities, relationships, validation, and tier system
- **contracts/api-schema.yaml**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all endpoints
- **quickstart.md**: Development setup and deployment guide with tier information
- **Agent Context**: Updated Cursor IDE with project technologies

### Phase 2: Planning ✅ READY
- Ready for `/speckit.tasks` command to generate implementation tasks
- All technical unknowns resolved
- Architecture validated against constitution
- Development environment documented

## Next Steps

1. **Run `/speckit.tasks`** to generate detailed implementation tasks
2. **Begin development** following the task breakdown
3. **Follow quickstart guide** for local development setup
4. **Use API contracts** for frontend/backend integration
5. **Reference data model** for database implementation
