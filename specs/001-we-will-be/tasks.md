# Implementation Tasks: My Closet Virtual Try-On

**Feature**: My Closet Virtual Try-On  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Detailed implementation tasks organized by user story for independent development

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

## Dependencies

### Story Completion Order
1. **Phase 1 (Setup)** → Must complete before any other phase
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)** → Must complete before user stories
3. **Phase 3 (US1)** → Can start after Phase 2, independent of other stories
4. **Phase 4 (US2)** → Depends on US1 (needs clothing items to select from)
5. **Phase 5 (US3)** → Depends on US1 and US2 (needs items and selection)
6. **Phase 6 (Polish)** → Depends on all user stories being complete

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 3 (US1) - Can run in parallel:**
- T021, T022, T023 (different files, no dependencies)
- T025, T026, T027 (different components, no dependencies)
- T031, T032 (different aspects of same story)

**Phase 4 (US2) - Can run in parallel:**
- T036, T037 (different files, no dependencies)
- T038, T039, T040 (different components, no dependencies)
- T045, T046 (different aspects of same story)

**Phase 5 (US3) - Can run in parallel:**

- T052, T053 (different components, no dependencies)
- T058, T059 (different aspects of same story)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Recommended)
Start with **Phase 3 (User Story 1)** only:
- Focus on core clothing upload and organization functionality
- This provides immediate user value and validates the core concept
- Can be deployed and tested independently
- Establishes the foundation for subsequent features

### Incremental Delivery
1. **Sprint 1**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Setup and Foundational)
2. **Sprint 2**: Phase 3 (User Story 1) - Core closet functionality
3. **Sprint 3**: Phase 4 (User Story 2) - Selection functionality
4. **Sprint 4**: Phase 5 (User Story 3) - AI try-on functionality
5. **Sprint 5**: Phase 6 (Polish) - Production readiness

### Success Metrics
- **US1**: 20+ clothing items uploaded and organized in under 5 minutes
- **US2**: Selection process completed without errors
- **US3**: AI processing completes within 30 seconds, generates realistic results
- **Overall**: 90% of users complete first virtual try-on without assistance

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 75
- **Setup Tasks**: 10 (T001-T010)
- **Foundational Tasks**: 10 (T011-T020)
- **User Story 1 Tasks**: 15 (T021-T035)
- **User Story 2 Tasks**: 13 (T036-T048)
- **User Story 3 Tasks**: 14 (T049-T062)
- **Polish Tasks**: 13 (T063-T075)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45+ tasks can run in parallel within their respective phases

**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear, testable acceptance criteria

**Suggested MVP**: Start with User Story 1 (clothing upload and organization) for immediate user value
