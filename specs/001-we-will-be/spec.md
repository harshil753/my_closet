# Feature Specification: My Closet Virtual Try-On

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-will-be`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we will be using a web application that will allow users to upload pictures of clothing to an online site that get added to their virtual closet. When uploaded these pictures will be compressed to an optimized jpeg image and then loaded up to a database, supabase to start but potentially shifted to Cloudflare R2 or Backblaze B2 in the future. The images can then be viewed in the user's virtual closet. The user can also choose to try on clothes virtually. When they choose this option they can choose one or more of the clothing types. Next the user will choose which clothing items they wish to try on and continue. From there the images of the items they selected along with the User Base Picture(s) the user uploaded earlier are sent to gemini AI as inputs using the prompt found in @ai_studio_code.py. The model will then provide an output image of the user wearing the articles of clothing they selected showing them how they may look in that outfit. This process flow can be further understood by looking at the @wireframe.png."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Upload and Organize Clothing Items (Priority: P1)

A user wants to build their virtual closet by uploading photos of their clothing items, organizing them by category (shirts/tops, pants/bottoms, shoes), and viewing their collection.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the application - without the ability to upload and view clothing items, the virtual try-on feature cannot function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading clothing images and verifying they appear correctly in the categorized closet view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has clothing photos on their device, **When** they select "Add Things to My Closet" and choose a category, **Then** they can upload multiple images and see a confirmation message
2. **Given** a user has uploaded clothing items, **When** they navigate to "My Closet", **Then** they can view their items organized by category (Shirts/Tops, Pants/Bottoms, Shoes)
3. **Given** a user is viewing their closet, **When** they click on a specific item, **Then** they see a detailed view of that clothing item

### User Story 2 - Virtual Try-On Selection (Priority: P2)

A user wants to select clothing items from their virtual closet to virtually try on, choosing from different categories and specific items.

**Why this priority**: This enables the core virtual try-on functionality by allowing users to select what they want to wear.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting clothing items from the closet and verifying the selection process works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has clothing items in their closet, **When** they click "Lets Try On Clothes", **Then** they can select one or more clothing categories to try on
2. **Given** a user has selected clothing categories, **When** they click "Continue", **Then** they can choose specific items from each selected category
3. **Given** a user has selected specific clothing items, **When** they confirm their selection, **Then** the system prepares the selected items for virtual try-on

---

### User Story 3 - AI-Powered Virtual Try-On (Priority: P3)

A user wants to see how they would look wearing selected clothing items by using AI to generate a realistic image of themselves in the chosen outfit.

**Why this priority**: This is the main value proposition of the application, but requires the previous stories to be functional first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing user base pictures and selected clothing items to the AI system and verifying a realistic output image is generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has selected clothing items and has uploaded base pictures, **When** they initiate the virtual try-on, **Then** the system processes the images and generates a realistic output
2. **Given** the AI processing is complete, **When** the user views the result, **Then** they see a high-quality image of themselves wearing the selected clothing items
3. **Given** a user is not satisfied with the result, **When** they want to try again, **Then** they can return to the selection process and choose different items

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user uploads non-clothing images?
- How does the system handle poor quality or blurry clothing photos?
- What occurs when the AI processing fails or times out?
- How does the system handle users who haven't uploaded base pictures for virtual try-on?
- What happens when a user tries to select items from empty categories?

### Edge Case Requirements

- **FR-019**: System MUST reject non-clothing images with clear error messages
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle poor quality images by providing enhancement suggestions
- **FR-021**: System MUST prevent virtual try-on when user lacks base photos
- **FR-022**: System MUST display appropriate messages for empty clothing categories
- **FR-023**: System MUST implement timeout handling for AI processing (max 60 seconds)
