## User Input

```text
tasks 37
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     * Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:
     ```
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```
   - Calculate overall status:
     * **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     * **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items
   
   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     * Display the table with incomplete item counts
     * **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     * Wait for user response before continuing
     * If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     * If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
   
   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     * Display the table showing all checklists passed
     * Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

5. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

6. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

7. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

8. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Tasks in PowerShell**

I need to implement "speckit.implement tasks 37" using special commands defined in a specific task file. We're under developer instructions to use tools and management for deployment. I need to run a PowerShell script to check prerequisites, but the directory for scripts isn't showing up, which might cause Step 1 to fail. I’ll check for the directory's existence first and then look for the script using directory search tools. I'll ensure to handle any issues gracefully. Plus, I'll read the task details from the tasks file!
**Focusing on Task 37 Implementation**

The outline indicates that I should implement all tasks, but the user specifically asked for task number 37. The speckit documentation emphasizes executing the plan in tasks.md, so I need to narrow my focus accordingly. I'll also check the checklists in the FEATURE_DIR. Although I won’t know the FEATURE_DIR yet, it seems like it could be specs/001-we-will-be based on the project layout, which confirms the existence of a checklists folder. I’ll proceed to read checklist files and load relevant documents to extract the necessary tasks, focusing on task 37 and its dependencies.
**Executing Task 37 Implementation**

I need to implement task 37 and that may involve code changes, so I’ll start by opening and modifying relevant files. I must ensure I follow user rules: being concise and providing a</details></think>
