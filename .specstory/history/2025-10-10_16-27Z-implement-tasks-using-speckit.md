## User Input

```text
tasks 36
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     * Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:
     ```
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```
   - Calculate overall status:
     * **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     * **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items
   
   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     * Display the table with incomplete item counts
     * **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     * Wait for user response before continuing
     * If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     * If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
   
   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     * Display the table showing all checklists passed
     * Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

5. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

6. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

7. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

8. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning project checks**

I see that the project layout includes a checklists folder within the specified path, containing a single file. First, I’ll confirm this by listing its contents. To follow the tool-calling guidelines, I’ll start with a status update before making any tool calls. I need to check for the existence of `.specify/scripts/...` by listing the `.specify` directory, but I'll avoid heavy lifting and just check immediate contents, skipping further checks if needed. Then, I plan to parse checklists and read relevant markdown files in parallel. Finally, I'll look for Task 36 in tasks.md to implement necessary code changes.
**Processing Task 36**

I need to figure out what Task 36 is, so I'll start by reading tasks.md and any related files. Since this task is complex, I should use the todo_write tool to create structured items for it. I also need to be mindful of the user's request to stop operations if they take too long—I'll set bounded call limits. First, I'll provide a status update: "I'm checking for prerequisite scripts and loading specs files." Then, I'll make parallel tool calls to list the necessary directories and read the relevant files.
**Executing parallel tool calls**

I plan to use multi_tool_use.parallel for about 5-7 calls: listing directories like `.specify` and checklists, along with reading files such as tasks.md, plan.md, data-model.md, research.md, quickstart.md, and listing directories in contracts. After that, I'll parse checklists to check for any incomplete items and count checkbox lines. I'll need to list the checklists directory before reading any markdown files since I can't use globs. If there are incomplete checklists, I’ll halt and ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.
**Assessing checklist status**

After I compute the statuses, I’ll need to ask the user for confirmation if I find any incomplete items. The developer instructions tell me to keep going until the user's query is fully resolved, but the command outline is clear that I have to stop and ask if any checklists are incomplete. So, I’ll start by making the initial tool calls to get the checklist statuses. I should provide a status update before running parallel calls, starting with listing the directory for ".specify/scripts/powershell". Then I can move forward accordingly.
**Making tool calls**

Alright, I’m ready to proceed with the tool calls. I’ll start with listing the checklist directory and then read relevant files, specifically tasks.md, plan.md, and data-model.md. I initially planned for eight calls, but since the guidelines suggest 3-5 to avoid timeouts, I should aim for around 6-7 instead. I can skip reading research.md and quickstart.md for now and focus on listing the necessary directories and files. So, I’ll go ahead with those first calls and see how it goes!</details></think>

---

I'll check for the prerequisites script and load the spec files (tasks, plan, data-model, contracts) and scan the checklists directory to compute completion status. I'll run these lookups in parallel now.

I'll run the prerequisites script and load related spec files in parallel, and scan the checklist to compute completion status. Then I'll inspect `lib/types/try-on.ts` to implement T036 if we proceed.

can you resume your task

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying implementation steps**

I’ve realized that if any checklists are incomplete, I need to stop before moving forward with implementation. Reading code is fine, but I must follow the plan closely. I will compute the checklist first, then ask the user for confirmation if anything is incomplete. According to instructions, I can read the spec files and code as part of context loading. I just need to ensure I don’t proceed with implementations until I get a "yes" from the user.
**Updating status on prerequisites**

In this status update, I’m focusing on checking prerequisites and checklists. I need to run a PowerShell script to check prerequisites using the command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks`, ensuring it's not in the background. I'll also read the checklist file, parsing the necessary features later. Since I've already reviewed tasks, plans, and data models, I can now compute checklist status after retrieving the script's JSON output and presenting the results to the user for confirmation.</details></think>

---

I'll run the prerequisites check and scan the `checklists/requirements.md` to compute completion status before proceeding.
